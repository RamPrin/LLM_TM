I've analyzed the container security threat model and categorized the threats using the STRIDE methodology. Here's a comprehensive list of the threats identified:

## Spoofing
- **Unauthorized Registry Access**: Attacker impersonates legitimate user to access container registry
- **Container Identity Spoofing**: Malicious container masquerades as a trusted service
- **Admin Credential Theft**: Unauthorized access to host system using stolen admin credentials

## Tampering
- **Malicious Container Image**: Introduction of malicious code via compromised container images
- **Configuration Manipulation**: Unauthorized modification of container configurations
- **Host File System Tampering**: Container escapes leading to modification of host files

## Repudiation
- **Missing Container Logs**: Inadequate logging of container activities prevents audit trails
- **Registry Action Repudiation**: Inability to track who pushed/pulled specific container images
- **Admin Action Non-Attribution**: Lack of accountability for administrative actions

## Information Disclosure
- **Insufficient Isolation**: Weak isolation between containers allows for information leakage
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Improper handling of application data classified as sensitive
- **Configuration Data Leakage**: Exposure of restricted configuration information
- **Container Network Compromise**: Interception of unencrypted container-to-container communication

## Denial of Service
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Denial of service by exhausting host resources from container
- **Container Engine Flooding**: Overwhelming container engine with deployment requests
- **Kernel Resource Depletion**: Excessive syscalls from containers affecting kernel performance

## Elevation of Privilege
- **Container Escape**: Attacker escapes container isolation to access host system
- **Shared Kernel Exploitation**: Attacker exploits vulnerability in shared kernel affecting all containers
- **Privileged Container Abuse**: Misuse of containers running with elevated privileges
- **Container Engine Compromise**: Gaining control of the container engine to manipulate all containers

This analysis identifies 20 distinct threats across all STRIDE categories, providing security coverage for the containerized application environment.
