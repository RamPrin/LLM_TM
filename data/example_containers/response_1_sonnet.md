# Threats

Based on the PyTM threat model for virtual containers, here are the threats identified using the STRIDE methodology:

## Spoofing:

1. Container Registry Spoofing: Attacker impersonates legitimate container registry to distribute malicious images. +
2. Developer Account Compromise: Attacker steals developer credentials to push malicious container images. +
3. Orchestrator API Spoofing: Attacker impersonates the orchestration system to issue unauthorized commands. +
4. Admin Credential Theft: Attacker obtains system administrator credentials to gain management access.
5. Malicious Base Image: Attacker publishes a compromised base image that appears legitimate. +
6. Container Identity Spoofing: Container masquerades as another container to gain trust or access resources.
7. Host Identity Spoofing: Attacker spoofs host identity to receive sensitive container communications.

## Tampering:

1. Image Tampering: Modification of container images during transit or storage. +
2. Container Configuration Tampering: Unauthorized modification of container configuration files.
3. Kernel Module Tampering: Insertion of malicious kernel modules affecting container isolation. +
4. Container Runtime Tampering: Modification of container runtime software to compromise containers.
5. Host File System Tampering: Direct modification of container files on host storage. +
6. Registry Data Tampering: Unauthorized modification of images in the container registry. +
7. Inter-container Communication Tampering: Modification of data exchanged between containers.
8. Orchestration Configuration Tampering: Unauthorized changes to orchestration platform configuration.

## Repudiation:

1. Container Action Denial: Container performs malicious actions with insufficient logging to trace. +
2. Image Upload Repudiation: Developer denies uploading a problematic or malicious container image. +
3. Administrative Action Denial: Administrator denies performing unauthorized management actions. +
4. Container Access Denial: User denies accessing container resources without proper audit trails.
5. Registry Access Repudiation: User denies downloading or uploading specific container images. +
6. System Call Audit Gaps: Insufficient logging of container system calls to kernel.+ 
7. Inter-container Communication Logging Gaps: Incomplete logs of communications between containers.

## Information Disclosure:

1. Container Data Leakage: Sensitive data exposure from one container to another or to host. +
2. Shared Kernel Information Leakage: Container gains access to kernel information from other containers. +
3. Image Layer Secrets Exposure: Secrets embedded in container image layers. +
4. Environment Variable Exposure: Sensitive data in container environSZment variables.
5. Registry Access Token Leakage: Exposure of registry authentication tokens. +
6. Volume Mount Data Exposure: Improper volume mounts exposing host or other container data. +
7. Container Memory Inspection: Unauthorized access to container memory revealing sensitive information.
8. Network Traffic Sniffing: Unencrypted inter-container or container-to-external communications. +
9. Container Log Information Leakage: Sensitive information written to container logs.

## Denial of Service:

1. Resource Exhaustion Attack: Container consumes excessive CPU, memory, or I/O affecting other containers. +
2. Kernel Panic from Container: Container causes kernel panic affecting entire host system. +
3. Container Runtime Overload: Flooding container runtime with requests disrupting service. +
4. Storage Depletion: Container fills storage space affecting host and other containers. +
5. Network Flood from Container: Container launches network flood affecting system networking.
6. Container Registry Overload: Excessive pull requests affecting image distribution. +
7. Orchestrator API Flooding: Denial of service on orchestration platform management API. +
8. File Descriptor Exhaustion: Container exhausts available file descriptors on host.
9. Container Restart Loop: Container repeatedly crashes and restarts consuming resources. +

## Elevation of Privilege:

1. Container Escape: Container breaks isolation to gain host system access. +
2. Privileged Container Abuse: Misuse of privileged container capabilities to access host resources.
3. Kernel Vulnerability Exploitation: Container exploits kernel vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.
4. Insecure Volume Mounts: Container accesses sensitive host paths through volume mounts.
5. Container Runtime Vulnerability: Exploiting vulnerability in runtime to gain higher privileges.
6. Orchestrator Access Control Bypass: Bypassing orchestrator security controls to manage unauthorized containers.
7. Namespace Breakout: Escaping container namespaces to access other containers or host.
8. Capabilities Abuse: Exploiting overly permissive Linux capabilities assigned to containers.
9. Seccomp/AppArmor Bypass: Circumventing container security mechanisms to perform restricted actions.
10. Host Process Impersonation: Container process masquerading as a host process.
11. Build-time Backdoor: Privilege escalation vector hidden during image build process.
